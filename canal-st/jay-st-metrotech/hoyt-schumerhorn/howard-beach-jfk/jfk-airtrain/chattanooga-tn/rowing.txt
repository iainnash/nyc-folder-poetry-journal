i rowed with my brothers.

i started rowing with them in high school

my senior year me and 2 of my brothers 
plus one other guy were all in one quad
boat. we made it to youth nationals!

after rowing, many workouts don't seem too intense.

we'd practice and workout at a boathouse right
on the riverfront
