broadway plays~

phantom of the opera
  - saw this after hearing the soundtrack for years
    a classic and i'd recommend

miss saigon
  - went w a best friend for her birthday
    music was great, production was fun
    overall theme and setting felt problematic for me but was fun

disney aladdin
  - with my little sister and parents
    great production, nice music etc.
    wished the story was a little less... expected

kinky boots
  - one of the few musicals i really enjoyed
    really enjoyed the acting from the cast

the play that goes wrong
  - this play has been following me since london
    got rush tickets -right- up front and got 
    gusts of water, air and audience members yelling
    right at the front. unusual but so much fun.
